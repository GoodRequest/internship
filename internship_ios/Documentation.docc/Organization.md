# Organization

Everything you need to know about organization, meetings, communication and tools.

## Meetings

![Meet](meet)
We will meet 2 times a week on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com). Every Monday you will receive invitations to events that will include link to join online conference. Check the description of the meeting so you know all the important information. Please use the Decline or Accept option in the meeting so we know if you are joining us.

#### Presentation / Live coding

Every Wednesday 14:00 - 16:00

#### Consultations

Every Tuesday 13:00 - 15:00

## Slack

![Xcode](slack)
We will use [Slack](https://slack.com) for all the communication about practical task or lectures. You can use online, desktop or mobile version of the web. You will receive an invitation to join our GR workspace by the end of first week.

Feel free to ask anything in the channel, try to avoid direct message question. Someone else is probably wondering the same question.

>Tip: If you don't want to miss out any information, we recommend you to use mobile app and turn on the notifications for messages and mentions.

## Xcode

![Xcode](xcode)
For development we will use [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/sk/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Current released version is _13.2.1_, but _13.3 beta_ is also acceptable. Don't go bellow _13.2_. If you already have Xcode installed, please update to the latest version.

## Final review

After 8 weeks you should have our project done. I will clone your project from Github and together we will discuss the final product.
